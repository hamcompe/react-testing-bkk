# React testing BKK

This project has been built to show the examples of code, related to my talk at [React Bangkok 3.0.0 conference](https://reactbkk.com/3.0.0/).

## Setup

Run

```shell
yarn
```

I use [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) so, there is no need to go to one by one directory and run `yarn`.

## Running the app

To get the app up, run

```shell
yarn dev
```

## Project structure

```
|— client
|— cypress
|— server
...
```

### client

> contains all the web source code

### cypress

> contains all the end-to-end testing code

### server

> contains the mocking server code
